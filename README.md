    nutrientContent: NutrientContent(...),
    properties: FoodProperties(...)
))
```

You can also extend the exercise database by adding activities to `ExerciseDatabase.loadActivities()`:

```swift
activities.append(ExerciseActivity(
    name: "Your Exercise",
    category: .cardio,
    intensity: .moderate,
